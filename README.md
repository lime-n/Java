# JAVA

The folder `java exercises` contains my practical answers to the book:

Parsons, D. 2020. Foundational Java: Key elements and practical programming. Springer.

This folder will contain complete solutions to all of these exercises (PENDING)

The folder `Programming` contains the exercises to lab materials from the moduling `Programming II` from the University of East Anglia.

As for the next folder, `Java Machine Learning`. These contain the solutions to the workshops for the
module Machine Learning at the University of East Anglia. A third year computer science module.

The aim is to compile the code effectively and clearly, then examine this in R-studio and develop similar techniques using R.
